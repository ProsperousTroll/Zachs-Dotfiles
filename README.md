# Zach-s-Hyprland-Dotfiles
Simple, yellow, beautiful. No BS. Just some unix goodness, using Hyprland, Waybar, and hyprpaper. 

## PREREQUISITES

- Hyprland
- Hyprpaper
- Kitty
- Fastfetch
- Yazi
- Nemo
- Rofi
- Btop

Here's a handy command you can paste to install all the prerequisites: 

`sudo pacman -S hyprland kitty hyprpaper fastfetch yazi nemo rofi btop`

(I'm pretty sure you can replace 'pacman -S' with 'apt install' on debian-based distros, but you might need some additional configuration or packages for them to work out of the box. Discretion is adviced and what not.)
